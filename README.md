# README

This is a webapp developed for a leadership class in which we were tasked to create a tech product for teams in the class to give and receive feedback to and from their teammates. 

The student-side solution was separate, but results are stored in a MySQL database provisioned with CLEARDB through Heroku and reported via a TA hub at muditgoyal.com.

I will release login information once the class has resolved.
